# Miscommunication

Miscommunication is a multiplayer webapp game. Players each start with a word. A player then draws a representation of that word.  The drawing is passed to another player to guess what it is and so on. At the end each player can view the words and images in their "chain".

-----------------------------------
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Testing Tip

Run in multiple guest accounts in Chrome so that each window has it's own local storage.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
